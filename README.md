Writing by hand boosts your ability to retain information, comprehend new ideas, and be more
productive. Studies show that writing improves memory; students retain learning better when
working with new ideas through handwriting instead of typing. After being taught in school,
students should be relatively competent in handwriting. Unfortunately, this is not the case in
reality. Many people face difficulties with improving their handwriting skills. Additionally, typing
on a keyboard has made people disregard having good handwriting these days. Consequently,
we may encounter unreadable handwriting. Therefore, we decided to do the project with
following objectives:
1. Find method to detect and rate people's handwriting using transfer learning model;
2. Predict peopleâ€™s handwriting quality;
3. Deciding the best machine learning model to solve this problem.

One way to improve handwriting is practice. But, practicing handwriting might be inefficient
because it needs another person to rate the handwriting. Besides, people may feel insecure to
show their handwriting to others. An android application might be sufficient to help improve
handwriting. To summarize, bad handwriting may exist because of different causes like habit,
background, etc. With objectives as mentioned before, we intend to help people in improving
their handwriting.
